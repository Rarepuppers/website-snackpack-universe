- Add `debug=1` to the normal or stress route for collision labels and live entity/effect counts.
- Add `theme=bastion-standard|emberfall|toxic-bloom|void-approach|arctic-relay` to pin an arena background theme; without it each load draws one from the pool.
- Decision overlays support arrows/WASD/left-stick navigation, Enter/Space/pad-A confirm, and digits 1–4 quick pick; disabled Shop rows are skipped and cannot be confirmed.
- Add `size=100..300` to preview the planned game-size setting; the canvas always snaps to whole physical pixels.

- `/play/last-bastion/?scenario=aurum-hoarder&loadout=bulwark` — Aurum Hoarder forage/flee lab with armour-break Scrap, edge-exit marker, and guaranteed supply-cache reward
- `/play/last-bastion/?scenario=scrap-shop&loadout=vertical` — seeded four-row Scrap Shop lab with three live offers, affordability states, repeat purchasing, and explicit leave/bank action

- `/play/last-bastion/?mode=gallery&batch=n` — Task 36 Aurum body/effects/cache family and eight 128 px runtime tiles
- `/play/last-bastion/?mode=gallery&batch=n2` — production Scrap Shop panel, six 128 px offer tiles, and four 128 px Scrap HUD/effect frames

## Codex

`/play/last-bastion/last-bastion-codex.html` is the encyclopedia and tile gallery (characters, weapons,
Monsterdex, upgrades, perks, powerups, relics, ammo, damage types, DoT). It is a static page outside the
Vite app — serve the website root to view it, not the dev server. Every entry requests
`game-assets/tiles/<id>-v1.png` and falls back to a placeholder, so dropping tile art in upgrades both
the codex and the game's future character-select/shop screens.

## Architecture

- `arena/` owns portable arena geometry and collision resolution.
- `assets/` owns stable asset IDs, logical sizes, frame contracts, and pivots.
- `combat/` owns deterministic gameplay state and events.
- `effects/` owns pooled transient rendering.
- `rendering/` maps portable state to Phaser presentation.
- `ui/` owns the camera-safe HUD and run-state panels.
- `scenes/AssetGalleryScene.ts` is the production-art validation surface.

Placeholder rendering remains available as a comparison tool, but styled production-test art is the default renderer.

The normal arena is larger than the viewport and uses bounded camera follow. HUD and decision UI remain camera-fixed; live text renders at higher texture resolution and decision cards use scalable surfaces rather than stretched bitmap panels.
